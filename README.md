### Changes in residential UPRN numbers in the North East Region of England, 2020-2024

Each property in the UK has a Unique Property Reference Number(UPRN), and residential UPRNs are the places a person can live (aside from hotels, hospitals and prisons, etc).
As the population grows it's expected that the number of residential UPRNs should increase. And this has been the case across England, but the North East region has had a slower rate of growth than the rest of the country.

This map is an interactive tool to look at changes in UPRNs at the middle layer super output area (MSOA - an area containing 2000-6000 households). The geography for this is [Middle layer Super Output Areas (December 2021) Boundaries EW BFC V6](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/608940e46ed649e3b00a5409befe31f8_0/explore?location=53.993921%2C-0.331215%2C6.74), used for census reporting. This was chosen as a compromise between detail and speed - the areas are small enough to show interesting trends but large enough to show up even on a relatively small map (which this script generates, as well as a more interactive version).

Boundaries as shown on the maps are purely illustrative - they have been simplified to increase load speed but the data underneath is in the right place. If you zoom in too closely on the interactive map the boundaries can be a bit janky but the info is correct (or as correct as I can get it!)

Please note you will need geopackages installed to make use of this (Geopandas and Folium especially). You will also need Panel.

Instructions are included in the Jupyter Notebook!
